# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Created by Zach Valadez

## Goal of this Project
1) A tidy data set as described below.
2) A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis.
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4) You should create one R script called run_analysis.R
